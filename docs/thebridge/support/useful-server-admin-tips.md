Just create good-looking GUI via Chest Commands, set item prices \(requires Vault\) and in command to execute use command from your permissions plugin.

**Example:**

```text
cleaner-buy:
    ID: magma_cream
    COMMAND: 'console: pex user {player} add thebridge.kit.cleaner;tell: &eThanks for purchase!' #for PermissionsEx
    #COMMAND: 'console: lp user {player} permission set thebridge.kit.cleaner true;tell: &eThanks for purchase!' #for LuckPerms
    LORE:
       - '&7Clean map very fast and easy!'
       - '&7Click to buy for &e&l3000 coins'
    PRICE: 3000
    POSITION-X: 2
    POSITION-Y: 2
```

**2.** Edit kit descriptions in language.yml

Go to language.yml and modify descriptions of kits that you're selling via shop above. Add information that kit is available to buy for coins. **You must add enough spaces to wrap this line to next line.**
