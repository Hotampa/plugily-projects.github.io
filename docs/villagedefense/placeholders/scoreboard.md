| %PLAYERS% | Size of all players in arena |
| %PLAYERS\_LEFT% | Size of alive players in arena |
| %TIME% | Current arena timer \(ex. 10 seconds before start\) |
| %VILLAGERS% | Alive villagers number |
| %ZOMBIES% | Total zombies amount in wave \(not alive ones!\) |
| %ORBS% | Player's orbs amount \(game currency\) |
| %ROTTEN\_FLESH% | Arena's rotten flesh amount \(more flesh, more bonus hearts\) \(see more [here](http://167.86.90.57/wiki/minecraft/villagedefense/faq.php#can-i-set-up-secret-well-)\) |
